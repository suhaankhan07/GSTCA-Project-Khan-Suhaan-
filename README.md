Dark Matter Detection with AI using the BOSS Algorithm 

Gravitational lensing has been used for over three decades as effectively the only tool to reveal the nature of "dark" sources in the Milky Way. "Dark" sources include stars, planets, black holes, or even dark matter. The crux of efficient data utilization in light curve detection is pivotal for discovering dark objects. We hypothesized that by using six hundred thousand stars as data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, a telescope at Caltech that can scan the entire northern sky in two days, we could use Artificial Intelligence to increase the speed and accuracy of microlensing research. The main purpose of this project was to distinguish between microlensing and non-microlensing events, the former of which could be dark matter events. Through the rigorous testing of various Artificial Models, including Linear Regression, KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, and others, coupled with the use of the Bag of SFA Words (BOSS) Algorithm to reduce noise, we conduct a comparative analysis to discern disparities in accuracy, precision, and other statistical metrics among these models. Through hyperparameter tuning and eliminating false positives, the KNN model was confirmed to be the most accurate model, generating a 97% accuracy for detecting microlensing events within the Milky Way Galaxy.
